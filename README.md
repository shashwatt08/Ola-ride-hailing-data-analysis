# 📊 Ola Ride-Hailing Data Analysis: A Business Intelligence Case Study

### 🧠 Project Workflow
The analysis followed a structured and repeatable process to ensure accuracy and deliver a high-quality final product:
1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** The raw dataset, consisting of over 50,000 records of Ola rides, was initially processed using Excel to ensure data integrity and prepare it for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL:** Complex SQL queries were written to explore the data, calculate key metrics, and uncover initial patterns related to ride performance, customer behavior, and revenue.
3.  **Interactive Dashboard Creation:** The cleaned and analyzed data was imported into Power BI. A comprehensive dashboard was designed and built to visualize the key findings and provide an interactive platform for data exploration.
